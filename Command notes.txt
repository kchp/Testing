Initial setup:

	git config --list (list configurations)
	git config --global user.name "<name>" (change username)
	git config --global user.email "<email>" (change email)


Start project:

Navigate to project directory in Bash, using CD
	(cd ~     - move to workspace directory)
	(cd ..    - change to parent directory)
	(cd <dir> - change to directory, for directories with <space> in the name, use 'name')
	(ls       - list content of directory)
	(pwd      - show current directory)

When in desired directory
	git init (start project in current directory)
	

Managing files:

Staging
	git add . (stage all changes, made to project, for commit)
	git add <file> (stage changes, made to file, for commit)
	git reset HEAD <file> (unstage changes)

Delete file
	git rm <file> (remove file from repository and working directory. Does not commit removal)

Commit
	git commit -m "<message>" (commit present state, use message field to identify commit)
	git commit -a (automatically stage and commit everything that have been changed/deleted.
				   Take care when using this command, as it WILL grab everything that has been changed)

Commit log
	git log (show commit log)
	git log --author="<name>" (show commit log from specified user)
	
Differences
	git diff (shows differences between repository and actual file. This only shows differences between
			  repository and working copy, does not show staged changes)
